I discussed my solution with: Tomaso Mukai

Learning not only why to throw exception but how to handle them was interesting take away for me. There were some debugging issues as well as input issues. Trying to read from the command line took some strategizing and I still do not believe it is the best implementation. I could benefit next time to take more time to think about i/o a little more before I start implementing a solution.
